                    Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. You never know one of the things you touched might be contaminated with virus. If you touch these same hands having virus to your face, the virus may get transferred to your eyes, nose or mouth. To prevent touching your face, you can also resort to hand gloves.

                    Be it for work or any important purpose, make sure that you avoid travelling as much as possible.
                     Even if you are travelling avoid public transportation or vehicles that are crowded. Travelling means coming in contact with people and that should be avoided to prevent the spread of corona virus.

    <p class="Caption">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may<br>
    have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are<br>
    usually mild and begin gradually. Also the symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure</p>

          <p class="syt">People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.
               Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
              
               <li>Cough</li>
               <li>Fatigue</li>
               <li>Fever or chills</li>

           <p class="syt">Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

            COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.</p>
